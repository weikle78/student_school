The main learning objectives for this project were to be able to create a backend application connected to a database.  Be able to store information into that database and learn how to setup forms and deploy your application.

Most of the struggles I faced with this assignment were getting all of the proper applications to work on my laptop.  Once I was able to get everything synced up, it wasn't to hard to follow along with the tutorial.  

This tutorial will be very helpful in our Studio III project we are currently working on.  It is the same concept of creating a prompt and using that to store information into our database.  Also, the skills we are learning in Intro in Database class will help us in sorting the information and using the correct queries to pull information from that database.  It is really informative to see how Database and Programming tie into one another and what goes into it the accomplish that.
